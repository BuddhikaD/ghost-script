# Installing Ghost CMS with Docker Compose on Ubuntu

Ghost is a powerful app for new-media creators to publish, share, and grow a business around their content. It comes with modern tools to build a website, publish content, send newsletters & offer paid subscriptions to members.

# Before you Begin

Complete the Add DNS Records steps to register a domain name that will point to your IP,and you need to Replace all **example.com**,**your_database_root_password** where appears in _default.conf_ and _docker-compose.yml_ using your own details.

# Install Ghost

The Ghost deployment has three components:

- The Ghost service itself;
- A database (MySQL) that will store your blog posts;
- A web server (NGINX) that will proxy requests on HTTP and HTTPS to your Ghost service.
These services are listed in a single Docker Compose file

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BuddhikaD/ghost-script.git
cd ghost-script
chmod +x main.sh
./main.sh
```

# Shut down your containers

```bash
cd ghost
docker-compose down
```

# Run Docker compose in an attached state to view the logs generated by each container

```bash
docker-compose up
```

# Complete the Setup
To complete the setup process, navigate to the Ghost configuration page by appending **/ghost** to the end of your blog’s URL or IP. This example uses _https://example.com/ghost_

# Update Ghost

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

# Renew your Let’s Encrypt Certificate

* Open your Crontab in your editor:
```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

* Add a line which will automatically invoke Certbot at 11PM every day. Replace example.com with your domain:
```bash
0 23 * * *   certbot certonly -n --webroot -w /usr/share/nginx/html -d example.com --deploy-hook='docker exec ghost_nginx_1 nginx -s reload'
